## 🖥️ Overview

![Dashboard Overview](public/demo-png/1-CELL-TOWER-POP-REG.PNG)
> *Main dashboard showing tower distribution, filters, and live signal metrics.*

The **Network Analytics Dashboard** helps engineers, researchers, and analysts visualize tower coverage, signal strength, and performance indicators using **Google Maps**, **real-time analytics**, and **AI insights**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Interactive Map** – Visualize all nearby towers and their signal zones  
✅ **Smart Filtering** – Filter towers by signal strength, provider, country, or frequency  
✅ **AI-Powered Insights** – Automatically detect weak-signal zones and suggest optimizations  
✅ **Real-Time Search** – Instantly locate towers by ID, MCC, or region  
✅ **Data Export** – Export selected tower datasets for further analysis  
✅ **Responsive UI** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Apply Filters** – Choose filters like signal quality, provider, or MCC.  
2. **Search Quickly** – Use instant search to find any tower or region.  
3. **View on Map** – Click any tower marker for live data and AI summaries.  
4. **AI Analysis** – Tap the AI button to generate intelligent optimization insights.
